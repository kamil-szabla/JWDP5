E-commerce responisve website on already prepared backend. I have focused on the frontend in this project, making everything works and looks nice. Website shows list of the products as well as single product page with more details. Customers can presonalize buying options for each product, in this example lenses for camera. Fully working cart that informs how many products is in cart and what is the final price. To submit an order customer must fill the form with all the necessary details, after submiting, order ID is generated by the backend. 

### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation ###

Clone this repo. From within the project folder, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
